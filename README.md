# Jay's Google IT Support Cert Log

Started the Google IT Support Professional Certificate around March/April 2025. Using this space to track my progress, labs, and anything I learn or struggle with. Trying to get into an IT support role while building solid foundations.

## What I’ve Done So Far

### Course Progress
- [x] Technical Support Fundamentals
- [x] Networking
- [ ] Operating Systems
- [ ] System Admin & IT Infrastructure
- [ ] IT Security

### Labs & Hands-On Stuff
- Created and managed files/folders using CLI (Linux & Windows)
- Used commands like `mkdir`, `cd`, `rm`, `mv`, etc.
- Set up and worked in VMs using Google’s lab environments
- Starting to get more confident using the command line
- Learned how data moves over networks (IP datagrams, headers, DNS, routers, etc.)

---

## Current Focus
- Getting better with Linux commands and user permissions
- Understanding system administration basics
- Still wrapping my head around networking (IP headers were a headache ngl)

---

## Goals
- Finish the cert by September/October
- Land a junior IT job (support/help desk/etc.)
- Keep learning on the side — eventually interested in cybersecurity

## Notes
Balancing this with BJJ training, job hunting, and making content for my page. Some days are harder than others but still pushing forward.
