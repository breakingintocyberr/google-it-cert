# Lab: Creating a Folder (Windows & Linux)

```I completed this lab through Qwiklabs. It guided me through creating a folder using the `mkdir` command on both Windows and Linux.

*On Windows it allowed me to just create a new file using the GUI and rename to "My Super Cool File"

*On Linux I used the mkdir command to create a new folder by the same name.```
